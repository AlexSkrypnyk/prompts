## About this fork

This is a fork of the original Laravel Prompts package, modified to support 
additional features and use cases. See [`ADDITIONAL_FEATURES.md`](ADDITIONAL_FEATURES.md)
for a list of changes and enhancements made in this fork.

I pledge to maintain this fork and keep it up to date with the latest changes 
from the original repository.

### Installation

Installed via Composer:

Add the following to your `composer.json` file under the `repositories` section:

```json
{
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/prompts.git",
    "canonical": true
}
```
Then run:

```bash
composer require laravel/prompts
```

### Versioning Policy

This fork follows the upstream project closely while providing additional
patches. To ensure compatibility with Composer and standard Semantic
Versioning (SemVer), releases in this fork are always published under the same
major and minor versions as upstream, with only the patch number incremented.

For example, if upstreamâ€™s latest release is `v0.3.6` and this fork introduces
extra fixes before upstream publishes a new version, the fork will tag its
release as `v0.3.7`. If upstream later publishes `v0.3.7`, the fork will move
forward and release `v0.3.8`. This way, patch numbers always increase
sequentially, avoiding conflicts with upstream tags and guaranteeing a clear
upgrade path.

Consumers requiring this fork simply add it as a VCS repository and keep using
the upstream package name. Composer will then resolve dependencies to the fork,
and applications using a constraint such as `^0.3` will transparently receive 
the patched releases without needing to change version requirements.
